# Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your website to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account
2. A repository for your website (this project)

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Code is Already on GitHub âœ…

Your code has been pushed to the `main` branch. You're all set!

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/KoldLab/koldgeneration-website`
2. Click **Settings** â†’ **Pages**
3. Under "Source", select **GitHub Actions** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
4. Save the settings

That's it! GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site.

## Your Website URL

After deployment, your site will be available at:
- **`https://koldlab.github.io/koldgeneration-website/`**

## Automatic Deployment

Every time you push to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will:
1. Build your website
2. Deploy it to GitHub Pages
3. Your changes will be live in ~2 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

- Check the **Actions** tab in GitHub for error logs
- Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`

### 404 Errors on Routes

- This is normal for SPAs (Single Page Applications)
- The deployment workflow should handle this automatically
- If you see 404s, check that the build completed successfully

## Local Testing

Test the production build locally before deploying:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Visit `http://localhost:4173` to see how it will look on GitHub Pages.

## Notes

- The deployment workflow is in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Build output goes to `dist/` folder (gitignored)
- GitHub Pages serves from the `gh-pages` branch automatically
- You don't need a custom domain - the site works on the default `github.io` URL

## Future Custom Domain Setup

If you want to add a custom domain later:
1. Create a `public/CNAME` file with your domain
2. In GitHub Settings â†’ Pages, add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS records at your domain provider

But for now, you don't need any of that! Just enable GitHub Actions in Settings and you're done. ðŸŽ‰
